# Contribution Guide

### How to Contribute

When submitting a pull request (PR), please use the following guidelines:

- Try to keep pull requests short and submit separate ones for unrelated features, but feel free to combine simple bugfixes/tests into one pull request.
- Keep the number of commits small and combine commits for related changes.
- If you are introducing a new feature you may want to first submit your idea and plan as an issue.
- Bugfixes should include a unit-test or integration test reproducing the issue.
- Keep formatting changes in separate commits to make code reviews easier and
  distinguish them from actual code changes.


### Note

When you contribute code, you affirm that the contribution is your original work and that you license the work to the project under the project's open source license. Whether or not you state this explicitly, by submitting any copyrighted material via pull request, email, or other means you agree to license the material under the project's open source license and warrant that you have the legal authority to do so.
